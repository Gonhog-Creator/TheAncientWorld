This mod is currently a practice mod for me, learning to code and add things I want to the game. I have some ideas about a future 1.0, but they're far off. Otherwise, this is a mod requested by people of reddit to add some items to the game that would be missing from a 1.16 RLCraft modpack.

Feel free to leave suggestions and requests for items! I will try and get to them whenever I can, and implement things as I learn to code!



Currently, this mod adds:

- All rings of potion (Haste, Resistance, Speed, Strength, Regen, Jump Boost, and Night Vision) along with crafting materials

- Dragon Eye from trinkets and Baubles (More things to come soon, probably)

- Adamant Armor, to DEFINETELY be reworked, since it's too easy to get and stronger than Ice and Fire's dragonsteel

- Adds 9 new entities and one new structure (Wraith, Nipsie, Centaur, Stayr, Unicorn, Astrid, Dirt and Wood Golems, and Deer)

- Adds two new Legendary Swords

- Adds the Bow of Plenty and the Invisibility Glove -both can only be found in Stronghold libraries

      - For the Bow of Plenty, simply type in chat a number between 1 and 100 to shoot that many arrows at a time! You have a limit of 100 arrows per day, so use them wisely.



All ideas and textures for potion rings come from the original mod, (made by Vazkii_) and all credit goes to him.  This is a modified version by me, Gonhog.
